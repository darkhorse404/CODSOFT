# NUMBER GAME

Welcome! 

This is a Number guessing game. A random number between 0 to 100 will be generated each Round. You have to Guess the number that is generated. You will have 5 Attempts to make your guess each Round. If a wrong guess is made, you will be informed the guess is high or low. You will be rewarded points for each Round won and unused Attempts in that Round and your total Score will be scaled out of 10. 
Have a nice playtime!

This has a console-based user interface.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Usage

Following the Folder Structure, the `NumberGame.java` source file inside the `src` folder is needed to be Run for usage.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).
